# TARDIS
Hi! Welcome to my repository. This file will tell you all you need to know about my project.
Here's the link: (https://project-tardis.000webhostapp.com)

## Basics
This website is about the TARDIS Console, a futuristic machine that allows us to travel through space and time. On the website, there are four main pages. The register page allows us to make an account. On the login page, we can login to our existing account. But the main page is the Console page, which is where we actually operate the TARDIS. There is also a travel-history page, where we can see the travel logs.

## Frameworks
The project used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end & PHP and MySQL for the back-end. FontAwesome has been used for including icons. No additional frameworks or libraries have been used.

## Console
The TARDIS Console (https://project-tardis.000webhostapp.com/console) is the main operation page of the TARDIS. There are several buttons here, that might seem confusing. To start, we only have to click on a location on the map (where we wish to go), then enter the desired year in the textbox, and hit "Start". All the disabled buttons will activate.

## Buttons on Console
The first (yellow) button activates the Chameleon Circuit, which makes the TARDIS seem like an ordinary object (in this case, a telephone box). The second (light blue) button is the time rotor. By clicking on it, the rotor will activate, and if anything goes wrong, it will stop spinning. Next, we have the light green button with the star. This is the materialize button. The TARDIS can materialize/dematerialize through it. The dark blue button with the book is the Logs button. It redirects us to the travel history page, where the travel logs can be seen. Lastly, the red button is the emergency button. It immediately evacuates us back to the present.
